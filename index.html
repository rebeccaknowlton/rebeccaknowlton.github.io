            <p>Rebecca Knowlton is a PhD Candidate studying complex heterogeneity in the utility of surrogate markers under the supervision of Layla Parast. She passed her written preliminary exam in Spring 2021 and her oral candidacy exam in Spring 2023, and she expects to graduate in Spring 2025. During her doctoral program she has completed data science internships with Apple and Microsoft, applying statistical methodology to tackle industry problems like fraud prevention, application security, and enhanced buildout efficiency of cloud services. Prior to graduate school, Rebecca earned her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Trinity University, Summa Cum Laude. She worked as an actuarial analyst for three years, pricing automobile insurance and passing the first five CAS exams, before returning to school to pursue her doctorate in Fall 2020.</p>

              <p><ul>
              <li> Proposed novel measures for the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on the surrogate (PTE) with respect to multiple baseline covariates, via parametric and semiparametric procedures and including a bootstrapped variance estimation </li>
