            <p>Rebecca Knowlton is a PhD Candidate studying complex heterogeneity in the utility of surrogate markers under the supervision of Layla Parast. She passed her written preliminary exam in Spring 2021 and her oral candidacy exam in Spring 2023, and she expects to graduate in Spring 2025. During her doctoral program she has completed data science internships with Apple and Microsoft, applying statistical methodology to tackle industry problems like fraud prevention, application security, and enhanced buildout efficiency of cloud services. Prior to graduate school, Rebecca earned her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Trinity University, Summa Cum Laude. She worked as an actuarial analyst for three years, pricing automobile insurance and passing the first five CAS exams, before returning to school to pursue her doctorate in Fall 2020.</p>

              <p><ul>
              <li> Proposed novel measures for the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is explained by the treatment effect on the surrogate (PTE) with respect to multiple baseline covariates, via parametric and semiparametric procedures and including a bootstrapped variance estimation </li>

              <p>Rebecca Knowlton is a Statistics PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. After earning her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Trinity University, she worked as an actuarial analyst at USAA for three years while passing the first five exams with the Casualty Actuary Society. During this time, she served as the sole auto pricing analyst responsible for Texas, the company's largest state at roughly $1.9 billion written premium, and led the auto pricing team for loss trend analysis. She became interested in the other ways in which statistics and data science can be leveraged to solve complex problems, so she decided to return to school to begin a career in statistics research. Her research interests include machine learning, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics.</p>
